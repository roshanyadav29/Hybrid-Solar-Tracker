# Hybrid Solar Converter with LDR Automation and IoT-based Automated Error Detection

## Description
This project involves the development of a Hybrid Solar Converter system with sun-tracking, automated error detection, and seamless power source transition capabilities. It addresses challenges in solar power systems, ensuring efficient energy generation and reliable performance in various weather conditions.

The system optimizes energy generation by seamlessly switching between solar and AC power sources. It employs a sun-tracking mechanism that adjusts the solar panel's position based on the intensity of sunlight detected by Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) placed around the panel.

To ensure reliable performance, an automated error detection system continuously monitors the solar panel's power output. It compares the generated power with the required load and triggers a swift transition from solar to AC power if insufficient power is detected. Users are notified of this transition via phone or email.

Real-time alerts and notifications are facilitated by an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module integrated with the IFTTT platform. When an error in the solar panel's output voltage is detected, the module communicates with IFTTT to send notifications to designated devices.

The sun-tracking feature maximizes energy capture throughout the day by adjusting the solar panel's position based on the sun's direction. The automated error detection system promptly identifies and resolves power generation issues.

During adverse weather conditions, the system seamlessly switches to AC power, ensuring uninterrupted operation. Integration of the ESP8266 module and IFTTT platform enables remote monitoring and real-time notifications, empowering users to stay informed about system performance.

This project contributes to sustainable and technologically advanced clean energy solutions. It showcases the potential to enhance efficiency, reliability, and usability in solar power applications.
