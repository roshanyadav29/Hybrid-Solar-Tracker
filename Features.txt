Features

1: Solar Hybrid Converter:
Efficiency of a solar converting system depends on the weather conditions. Usually the solar panel gets four to five hours of bright sunlight in a day. If the weather is cloudy or rainy, it affects the charging process and the battery does not attain full charge. This simple hybrid solar converter can solve the problem as it can charge the battery or load using both solar power as well as AC mains supply. When output from the solar panel is above 12 volts, the battery charges using the solar power. When the output drops below 12 volts, the battery charges through AC mains supply.

2: Dual Axis Sun tracking System:
The proposed system consists of ATmega328 micro controller, Solar panel, Light Dependent resistors and Servo Motor. The position of the Sun with respect to the solar panel is not fixed due to the rotation of the Earth. For an efficient usage of the solar energy, the Solar panels should absorb energy to a maximum extent. This can be done only if the panels are continuously placed towards the direction of the Sun. So, solar panel should continuously rotate in the direction of Sun.

3: Automated Error detection:
This system consists of an Ex-or gate, ESP8266 WIFI MODULE and Voltage Regulator. The inputs to the Ex-or gate are from Arduino Uno and output of Ex-or gate is connected to input terminal of voltage regulator ASM1117.The GND pin of ESP8266 is Grounded along with GND of Arduino board. The output of Voltage regulator i.e. 3.3V is connected to terminal CH_PD and Vcc of ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module. Message is sent to registered mobile number via an Open Source website known as Ifttt.com.
