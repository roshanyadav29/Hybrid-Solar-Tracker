Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:

I.	Load is continuously ON.
II.	No visible fluctuations will occur while switching from solar power to AC supply or vice versa.
III.	Error detection.
IV.	Maximum Efficiency if solar panel is perpendicular to sun rays.
V.	Real time feedback via ESP8266.
VI.	No man power needed to monitor and control.
VII.	The solar energy can be used as it is renewable energy resource.
VIII.	This also saves money as there is no need to pay for energy used (excluding the initial setup cost).
IX.	Helps in maximizing the solar energy absorption by continuously tracking the sun via Dual Axis Sun Tracker.

Disadvantages:

I.	Heating of Transformer Overtime due to continuous Operation.
II.	Expensive One-time Cost.
III.	Though solar energy can be utilized to maximum extent this may not be as effective alternative and cause problems in rainy season.
IV.	Although solar energy can be saved to batteries, they are heavy and occupy more space and required to change time to time.
